# Step 1
Clone the repository 

# Step 2
Copy the path to your zeroth.html file 

# Step 3
Paste it in the "zeroth.py" file

# Step 4
Use a python freezer (like cs freeze in this example) to convert the python file to an application or manually run the python scripts .

# Precautions 
1. Make sure that zeroth.html, setup.py , nume.py and the logo.png are in the same folder while freezing 
2. Make sure to run Zeroth privately and delete the API keys after use . 
3. Utilise free credits (if available) to verify operations before using actual credits .
